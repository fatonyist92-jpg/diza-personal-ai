// Installing an engine, and signing in to it, from the app.
//
// Setup used to be a command to copy into Terminal. That is where most
// first runs went wrong: `npm i -g` on a stock Mac writes to a folder the
// user does not own and fails with EACCES, a Mac without Node has no npm
// at all, and a CLI that installed fine still answers nothing until it is
// signed in. Each of those read as "Bloks is broken" rather than as one
// step left to do.
//
// So the app runs the install itself, into the user's own ~/.local (no
// admin password, nothing to chmod), through their login shell so it sees
// the same node and PATH their Terminal does. What fails is translated
// into the one thing to do next. Signing in stays in Terminal, because
// every engine's login is its own interactive flow, but the app opens that
// Terminal with the command already running.
